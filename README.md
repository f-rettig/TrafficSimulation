README — Academic Integrity & Ethical Use of ChatGPT
Project: CMSC 335 Final Project — Traffic Simulation

Academic Integrity Statement
I, Felicia Rettig, affirm that this project represents my original work and that I have upheld the academic 
integrity policies of UMGC throughout its development.

While I leveraged ChatGPT as an AI assistant to:
Document intended design and logic decisions,

Brainstorm solutions to design and logic challenges,

Refine and comment code for clarity and maintainability,

Explain concepts related to JavaFX, multithreading, and simulation logic,

Review and edit non-assessed documentation (e.g., Javadoc, README, in-code comments),

All core design, logic, implementation, testing, and debugging decisions were made by me.
The AI did not write full classes independently, nor did it replace any critical thinking or problem-solving 
responsibilities essential to the course outcomes.


How ChatGPT Was Used
Clarifying JavaFX best practices and patterns.

Assisting in formatting consistent and meaningful comments.

Explaining physics unit conversions (e.g., meters to pixels).

Brainstorming improvements for user interface layout.

Helping identify edge-case bugs and offering troubleshooting suggestions.

Providing feedback on naming conventions, readability, and scalability.

No code or design decisions were blindly accepted without understanding or modification. 
I retained full control over the codebase and ensured that the AI's suggestions aligned with both the learning 
objectives of CMSC 335 and UMGC's ethical guidelines.


Compliance with UMGC & AI Use Policy
This work complies with:

UMGC’s Academic Integrity Policy

UMGC’s Acceptable Use of Artificial Intelligence Policy
(Used as a responsible educational aid, not as a replacement for assessed academic work.)


Final Note
All programming logic, problem-solving, and creative decision-making reflect my skills, learning, and mastery of CMSC 335 concepts.
ChatGPT was used as a supplementary tool, much like using textbooks, online documentation, or asking a tutor for conceptual guidance.
